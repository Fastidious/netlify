I'm an average husband to an amazing wife and proud father of little princess. We live in Brazil with our two cats and a house full of toys. I'm a sci-fi aficionado and also happen to design [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/)… in Sketch.

Since 2008, I’ve had the privilege of working with companies such as Paramount Pictures, SproutCore, Acrylic, AppZapper, The Echo Nest, Snowman, SuperMegaUltraGroovy, Vemedio and many others.

Anyway, if you're looking for some of my previous work, you can find it [here](/work).
