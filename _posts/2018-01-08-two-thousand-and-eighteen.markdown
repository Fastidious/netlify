Since I joined the [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/) team back in mid-2016, this site has been pretty much put on hold—until now.

During holidays I decided to take a break from Twitter, blow the dust off of this website and give [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) a good shot—I very much sympathise with [what they stand for](http://help.micro.blog/2015/why-i-created-this/) and I'm all for a more open and independent web.

My plan for this year is to rethink how I interact with social media, after the tumultuous one that was 2017.

Though, nothing will change for those who follow me on Twitter. Anything that I post here will be cross-posted there, following the [POSSE](https://indieweb.org/POSSE) content publishing model.

And with that being said—and if you like—you're more than welcome to [join me at Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/mmarfil).
