Since I joined the [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/) team back in mid-2016, this site has been pretty much put on hold—until now.

During holidays, I decided to take a break from Twitter, blow the dust off this website and also give [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) a good shot—I very much sympathize with [what they stand for](http://help.micro.blog/2015/why-i-created-this/) and I'm all for a more open and independent web.

With all the craziness that was 2017, I wanted to rethink how I interact with social media, and more importantly, take back control of my own content including my micro-posts.

So here we are.
