Since I joined the [Sketch](https://sketchapp.com/) team back in mid-2016, this site has been pretty much put on hold—until now.

During holidays I decided to take a break from Twitter, blow the dust off of this website and give [Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/) a good shot—I very much sympathise with [what they stand for](http://help.micro.blog/2015/why-i-created-this/) and I'm all for a more open and independent web.

Anyway, last year has been… odd, to say the least and that made me feel it's time to shake things up a bit and rethink how I interact with social media.

So with that being said, you're more than welcome to [join me at Micro.blog](https://micro.blog/mmarfil) or subscribe to my [JSON](https://mmarfil.com/feed.json) / [RSS](https://mmarfil.com/feed.xml) feeds.
